This is what I named NewsType page.<br/>
Of course, a news page is a NewsType page, so do blog or thread.

# What do NewsType Mine Tool do?
It can mine information from NewsType pages in Internet.

# How to use it?
First of all, you should download the source file which is coded by Java.<br/>
Then, compile it.<br/>
At last, by type java command in cmd.exe or other just as follow:<br/><br/>
    <code>java program.Program TASK_NAME HOME_PAGE_URL SAMPLE_NEWS_PAGE_URL SAMPLE_NEWS_START_TEXT SAMPLE_NEWS_END_TEXT</code><br/>
    <br/>
Get you a cup of coffee, when you back, all information you want is in your disk.

# NOTE
TASK_NAME              :      it can be anything, just name this information mining task.<br/>
HOME_PAGE_URL          :      a page containing lots of news page url, for example, a news site home page if you really want to mine news  <br/>
SAMPLE_NEWS_PAGE_URL   :      a sample of news page containing information you are interested in.<br/>
SAMPLE_NEWS_START_TEXT :      the start text of information you are interested, not most start text is ok <br/>

This is what I named <code>NewsType</code> page.<br/>
Of course, a news page is a <code>NewsType</code> page, so do blog or thread.

# What do NewsType Mine Tool do?
It can mine information from <code>NewsType</code> pages in Internet.

# How to use it?
First of all, you should download the source file which is coded by Java.<br/>

Get you a cup of coffee, when you back, all information you want is in your disk.
